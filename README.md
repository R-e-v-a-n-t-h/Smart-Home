# Smart-Home    --------->WORK IN PROGRESS
This is a project made with Arduino, Python, FastAPI, MongoDB and Flutter to showcase an idea of a centralised Smart Home System.
In this we can remotely switch on/off a smart home appliance through the app and even set timers for the same.
This acts on the Idea of a single centralised system that keeps making API calls and updates the smart home products' status' in real time
This is the project architecture given below


###The Main Branch only contains Images of the project in action
###Go to master branch for Frontend Code (Flutter)
###Go to backend branch for the backend Code (FastAPI)
###Go to hardware branch for the Arduino and the Python client code
