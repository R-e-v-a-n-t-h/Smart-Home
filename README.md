# Smart-Home
This is a project made with Arduino, Python, FastAPI, MongoDB and Flutter to showcase an idea of a centralised Smart Home System.
In this we can remotely switch on/off a smart home appliance through the app and even set timers for the same.
This acts on the Idea of a single centralised system that keeps making API calls and updates the smart home products' status' in real time
Check Out the images in this main branch to see how the project works.
